      "For avoidance of doubt, Xfinity Equipment remains Comcast-owned equipment, and Comcast retains title to all Xfinity Equipment, at all times, including but not limited to after payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee. \"Unreturned Equipment Fee\" refers to a fee charged by Comcast to a subscriber for any unreturned Xfinity Equipment upon termination of the Services provided under this Agreement. The payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee shall not result in a sale of, or the transfer of title to, any Xfinity Equipment, and such Xfinity Equipment shall remain the property of Comcast, and Comcast retains title to Xfinity Equipment at all times. Comcast in no way relinquishes ownership of (including title to) Xfinity Equipment by the payment of an Unreturned Equipment Fee. Even if an Unreturned Equipment Fee has been paid, Xfinity Equipment shall not be resold, used, or operated in any manner. If you pay an Unreturned Equipment Fee and subsequently return the Xfinity Equipment undamaged (with the exception of normal wear and tear), you will be refunded your Unreturned Equipment Fee in full. 8. USE OF THE SERVICES The Services are for personal, residential, non-commercial use only, unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing. We prohibit the following activities: · Reselling the Services in whole or in part; . Using the Services, directly or indirectly, for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable policy that we make available to you; · Using the Services to transmit, communicate, or store any information, data, or material in violation of any law, rule, or regulation; · Tampering with, making any unauthorized connection to, or modifying any part of our cable network or the Services for any purpose; · Attaching any unauthorized device to our cable network or the Services; or · Attaching anything to the Inside Wiring, the Xfinity Equipment, or Customer Equipment that impairs the integrity of our cable network, that degrades our cable network's signal quality or strength, or that creates signal leakage. You agree not to engage in these or other similar prohibited activities, or help anyone else do so. You acknowledge that you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of all persons who use the Services at your Premises (or any other locations authorized by us). You are solely responsible for ensuring that all other users of the Services understand and comply with this Agreement and any applicable policies. You are liable for all authorized and unauthorized use of the Services. If the Xfinity Equipment has been stolen or the Services have been used without your authorization or in violation of this Agreement, you agree to notify us immediately in writing, or by calling 1-800-XFINITY during normal business hours. If you violate this Agreement, or if you fail to notify us of unauthorized use in a timely manner, we may terminate the Services and recover damages. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to precisely calculate our lost revenue from unauthorized Services or tampering, you agree to pay $500.00 per device used to receive unauthorized Services as liquidated damages. These liquidated damages are in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or unreturned Xfinity Equipment, or other equipment owned by us, including any incidental costs. The unauthorized reception of the Services may also result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, and we reserve the right to report any illegal activities to law enforcement. In connection with your use of the Services, if you need to access third-party software or hardware, you will be subject to third-party terms and conditions. Certain components of the Services are also subject to our Software License Agreement, available at xfinity.com/terms/license. Your use of certain Services may also be subject to acceptable use policies, available at xfinity.com/policies. For example, our Acceptable Use for Xfinity Internet Policy is available at xfinity.com/ Corporate/Customers/Policies/HighSpeedInternetAUP. To understand how we collect and use information through the Services, please read our privacy policy, available at xfinity.com/Corporate/ Customers/Policies/CustomerPrivacy. We may amend these policies and agreements from time to time, with or without notice to you. You should consult these policies and agreements regularly to comply with the most recent versions. We incorporate these additional policies and agreements (including any amendments) into this Agreement by reference. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT OR BLOCK ANY SERVICE USAGE AS WE DEEM NECESSARY TO PREVENT HARM TO OUR NETWORK, FRAUD, OR OTHER ABUSE OF THE SERVICES, OR AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY LAW. 9. TERMINATION This Agreement will remain in effect from Service activation until this Agreement is terminated (by us or by you), as described below. This Agreement may also be terminated if it is replaced by a revised agreement. a. How you may terminate If your Services are subject to a minimum term agreement, and you terminate all or any portion of the Services under the minimum term agreement before the end of the minimum term, you may be charged an early termination fee. Review your minimum term agreement for additional details. If your Services are not subject to a minimum term agreement, you may terminate the Services and this Agreement for any reason at any time. You must notify us that you want to terminate in one of the ways listed on xfinity.com/cancel. Applicable fees and charges for the Services may accrue until the Services have been disconnected, all Xfinity Equipment has been returned, and this Agreement has been terminated, subject to applicable law or the terms of any agreements we have with governmental authorities. At our election, and subject to applicable law, we may change our policy to continue all Services (or any part of them) through the end of the billing cycle in which we received your notice, which means those Services will terminate at the end of the applicable billing cycle. We may refund all prepaid monthly service fees charged for the Services after the effective date of termination, and we reserve the right to subtract from your refund any outstanding amounts due to us for the Services, for any affiliate or third-party services, or for other applicable fees and charges. Certain fees and charges are non-refundable and are also excluded. b. How we may terminate or suspend Services Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to immediately terminate or suspend the Services without notice for any reason or no reason. We also reserve the right to remove from the Services any information stored or transmitted by or to any users (e.g., email or voicemail). We may take these actions if we reasonably determine that your use of the Services: (i) violates this Agreement, any applicable policies, or any laws, rules, or regulations; (ii) interferes with our ability to provide the Services to you or to others; or (iii) interferes with or endangers the health or safety of our 3 personnel or third parties, including if you threaten, harass, or use vulgar or inappropriate language toward our personnel. We have discretion in deciding whether and why to terminate or suspend Services. If we continue providing Services, this does not mean we have reviewed or approved any use of the Services, or any information transmitted through the Services. c. You have certain obligations upon termination\n",
