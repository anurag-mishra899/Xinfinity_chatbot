### MultiAgent Workflow Example

This project implements a multi-agent workflow system designed for intelligent data querying and reasoning. At its core is a Supervisor Agent that orchestrates communication between:

1. SQL Agent – interacts with structured data using natural language to SQL translation.

2. RAG Agent – retrieves relevant context from unstructured documents and generates context-aware responses.

This architecture allows integration of structured and unstructured knowledge in a coordinated style.
